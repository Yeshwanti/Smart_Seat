# Smart_Seat
# The proposed solution aims to optimize restaurant table allocation using a smart, AI-driven approach that ensures fairness, efficiency, and real-time adaptability. The problem arises when restaurants rigidly assign tables based on exact group sizes—such as reserving 6-seater tables only for groups of six—leading to empty seats and longer waiting times for other customers. To solve this, a mobile and web-based system will be developed that integrates both customer-facing and manager-facing interfaces. Customers can pre-book tables for a limited 10-minute hold period through the app, while walk-in customers are added by the manager into the system upon arrival. The backend uses a priority-based algorithm enhanced with machine learning to decide which group gets the next available table. The priority score is calculated using factors like waiting time, group size-to-table fit ratio, reservation status, and overall seat utilization. When a table becomes free, the system assigns it to the group with the highest computed score, ensuring fair and efficient seating. If a reserved customer doesn’t arrive within 10 minutes, the table is automatically released to the next eligible group. Over time, the ML model learns from historical data—such as peak hours, average group sizes, and no-show rates—to dynamically adjust the priority weights and improve allocation accuracy. The manager dashboard allows real-time monitoring of table status, manual overrides, and analytics on customer flow. This hybrid system allows both online and offline users to coexist seamlessly, ensuring that no table remains idle unnecessarily and every customer receives an optimized dining experience powered by AI-driven decision-making.
